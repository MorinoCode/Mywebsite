          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time
            compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat

            Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying
            the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Morteza, and I am currently a student at
          Folkuniversitet, where I am pursuing a course in JavaScript. At
          Folkuniversitet, I have been diving deep into the world of web
          development, learning how to write efficient, clean, and scalable
          JavaScript code. This course is equipping me with the skills needed to
          build dynamic and interactive websites and applications. Alongside the
          technical aspects, I’m also learning about best practices in
          programming, debugging, and modern web development frameworks. My
          passion for coding stems from the desire to create meaningful digital
          experiences and to be part of a field that constantly evolves with new
          challenges and innovations. Through this education, I’m preparing
          myself for a career where I can contribute to real-world projects and
          continue growing as a developer. Thank you!
